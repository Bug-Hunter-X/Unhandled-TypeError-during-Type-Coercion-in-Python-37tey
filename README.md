This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating an uncommon error: an unhandled TypeError during implicit type coercion.  The `function_with_uncommon_error` attempts to divide 1 by the input `x`. If `x` is 0, a ZeroDivisionError is handled. If `x` is a string, a TypeError occurs during the implicit type conversion to a number.  The solution includes more robust error handling.
